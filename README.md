# iEagleMessageApp
# Project: Software Project Computer Network
The objective of the iEagle Messaging Application is to provide FGCU students and faculty with an alternative way to communicate that is quicker and easier than emailing. Instant Messaging technology is one that allows for online communication that promotes real-time transmission of short text messages, over the Internet, that allow for immediate response. Instant Messaging can operate over a local area network. The instant messaging application, called a client, would be located on any computer. The client would need to work by communicating with a server when the user is online and the application is running.
